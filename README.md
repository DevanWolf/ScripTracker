ScripTracker
============

A MOD Tracker in pure JavaScript that plays MOD, S3M and XM files in modern browsers.

The project comes with a stylish player interface for loading modules from your local machine and monitoring playback as you would expect from any tracker. Check out http://scriptracker.cheerful.nl for a working example.

Supported browsers are Chrome, Safari and Opera (Firefox support is comming soon).
